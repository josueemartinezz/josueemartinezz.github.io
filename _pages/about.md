<!-- SUMMARY -->
My name is Josue Martinez, I am studying Computer Science at the [University of California, San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu/) graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in June 2025. I'm a first-generation Latine who enjoys several applications of computing such software engineering, computing education, embedded systems, web development, machine learning, and cloud computing. 

<!-- CURRENTLY ON -->
## I'm currently...
1. Developing software at NSF funded DERConnect Research Lab. 
2. Wrapping up CSES's first iteration of the Alumni Mentorship Program.
3. Preparing the second iteration of the Alumni Mentorship Program and driving initiative for a web application to streamline manual work.
4. Developing learning initiative to embed Culturally Relevant Computing (CRC) principles into introductory programming courses at UCSD. 

<!-- PROJECTS -->
# Projects

## PantryPal ( [code](https://github.com/ucsd-cse110-fa23/cse-110-project-team-41) )
Purpose: Alleviating stress of college students who don't know what to cook with the ingredients they have.

Challenges: Testing frontend using JavaFx was a hassle, but I prioritized testing functionality on assumed events.

Tools: Java, MongoDB, JavaFX, Docker, UML, APIâ€™s (ChatGPT, Whisper, Dall-E), Mocking, Design Patterns

## Activist ( [code](https://github.com/josueemartinezz/activist) )
Purpose: Provide a platform that enables more people to safely engage in activism by making it easy to discover organizations and events as well as coordinate and collaborate on political action.

Challenges: Reading from a large code base took some time, but reading the system schema helped organize relationships between classes.

Tools: Django, Python, Redis, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, Next.js

## TrashPal ( [code](https://github.com/josueemartinezz/aisc) )
Purpose: Computer vision model to detect whether something should be composted, recycled, or thrown in the trash.

Challenges: Finding datasets to train the model, integrating it into an app to make it deployable.

Tools: Python, Yolo-v5, Computer Vision

## University Database ( [code](https://github.com/josueemartinezz/UniversityDatabase) )
Purpose: Master RDBMS by adding features that include schema design, custom indexing, materialized views, triggers, constraints, etc.

Challenges: Writing queries that required multi-layered joins across tables that I didn't expect to interact caused some complex queries.

Tools: PostgreSQL, Java, JSP, Tomcat Server

## Course Notetaker ( [code](https://github.com/josueemartinezz/reportLogger) )
Purpose: A command-line interface that allows users to start note-taking for a subject, stop the note-taking application, view all entries, or view a report of the time elapsed and notes for each subject.

Challenges: Starting from the ground up with my code base was something uncomfortable, but worth every UML diagram.

Tools: Django, Python, PostgreSQL

## File Compresssor and Decompressor ( [code](https://github.com/josueemartinezz/FileCompressor) )
Purpose: Using a huffman encoding, I learned how to read bytes from an input file and write to a output file in a smaller amount of bytes. Reducing compression size by 70%.  

Challenges: Knowing how integers can be represented in a more efficient way and stored in a smaller number of bytes. 

Tools: C++, GDB, Data Structures and Algorithms
