<!-- SUMMARY -->
My name is Josue Martinez, I am studying Computer Science at the [University of California, San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu/) graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in June 2025. I'm a first-generation Latine who enjoys several applications of computing such software engineering, computing education, embedded systems, web development, machine learning, and cloud computing. 

<!-- CURRENTLY ON -->
## I'm currently...
1. Developing software at NSF funded [DERConnect](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/new-grid-tech-sandbox-at-uc-san-diego-will-help-researchers-improve-low-carbon-electric-grids) Research Lab. 
2. Wrapping up CSES's first iteration of the Alumni Mentorship Program.
3. Preparing the second iteration of the Alumni Mentorship Program and driving initiative for a web application to streamline manual work.
4. Developing learning initiative to embed Culturally Relevant Computing (CRC) principles into introductory programming courses at UCSD.

<!-- # Projects

## File Compresssor and Decompressor ( [code](https://github.com/josueemartinezz/FileCompressor) )
Purpose: Using a huffman encoding, I learned how to read bytes from an input file and write to a output file in a smaller amount of bytes. Reducing compression size by 70%.  

Challenges: Knowing how integers can be represented in a more efficient way and stored in a smaller number of bytes. 

Tools: C++, GDB, Data Structures and Algorithms -->
