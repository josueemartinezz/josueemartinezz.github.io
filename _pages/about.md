My name is Josue Martinez, a third year studying Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I'm a first-generation Latine student who enjoys several applications of computing including, but not limited to, software engineering, computing education, embedded systems, web development, and machine learning. 

I'm currently working on... (as of May 6th, 2024)
------
0. Creating a computer vision model to detect whether something should be composted, recycled, or thrown in the trash.
1. Contributing to an open source web application called [Activist](https://activist.org/en/home/). 
2. Organizing and piloting CSES's first Alumni Mentorship Program, connecting our current members with industry professionals. 
3. Attempting to create learning initiative to embed Culturally Relevant Computing (CRC) principles into introductory programming courses at UCSD. 
4. Creating an PostgreSQL database that simulates UC San Diego's encompassing data such as courses, classes, students, departments, degrees, and more!
5. Tutoring CSE100: Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms at UC San Diego.

Experience
======
- **Computer Science and Engineering Department** (02/24 - Present)
  - **Instructional Assistant**
    - Tutoring for Professor [Niema Moshiri](https://niema.net/).
    - Provide personalized tutoring support for 400+ students addressing conceptual and coding issues related to C++ and diverse data structures, and assistance on algorithm formulation.
    - My responsibilities include answering questions during lecture, monitoring Zoom sessions and answering remote questions, promptly addressing student inquiries, providing lab hours for students, and prepping for weekly material.
- **Triton Solar Car** (10/23 - Present)
  - **Embedded Software Developer**
    - Utilized XCTU software application to test telecommunication between sender and receiver radio modules. 
    - Prototyped file writing to represent solar energy consumption variables using CANEdge loggers; successfully mocked file writing and uploading buckets of raw data over MinIO Server to simulate the driver and the technical team communication during implementation stage. 
    - My most recent task involved learning ESP32’s LittleFS filesystem to permanently save data for each node on the CAN bus. 
- **Computer Science and Engineering Society** (9/23 - Present)
  - **External Chair for Alumni**
    - I am responsible for configuring and maintaining our organization’s active alumni database with over 300 members.
    - Served as liaison for the entire organization by forging meaningful engagement, support, and contributions from alumni. 
    - I take over any responsibilities involving communication with UC San Diego alumni with technical backgrounds, consistently being a reliable resource for other departments when they require alumni-related assistance.


Undergraduate Research
======
<img src="/images/research.jpeg" width="50%" text-align="center">

**Objective**: Create a baseline environment that would evaluate fairness of college admission machine learning algorithms on the basis of income and test score. Thereby, promoting principles of equity and testing of deployed autonomous systems.

**Significance**: This project was a fusion of all my passions including computer science and 
philosophy; it involved purposeful computing that analyzes unfair disparities in college admissions.

- Policy Optimization with Advantage Regularization for Long-Term Fairness in Decision Systems [ [paper](/files/Research_Proposal.pdf) ] [ [poster ](/files/preview.jpg) ] [ [code](https://github.com/josueemartinezz/College-Admissions-Baseline) ] [ [parent code](https://github.com/ericyangyu/pocar) ]\
*Accepted into Early Research Scholars Program's National Conference*

Projects
======

PantryPal ( [code](https://github.com/ucsd-cse110-fa23/cse-110-project-team-41) )
------
Purpose: Alleviating stress of college students who don't know what to cook with the ingredients they have.

Challenges: Testing frontend using JavaFx was a hassle, but I prioritized testing functionality on assumed events.

Tools: Java, MongoDB, JavaFX, Docker, UML, API’s (ChatGPT, Whisper, Dall-E), Mocking, Design Patterns

Activist ( [code](https://github.com/josueemartinezz/activist) )
------
Purpose: Provide a platform that enables more people to safely engage in activism by making it easy to discover organizations and events as well as coordinate and collaborate on political action

Challenges: Reading from a large code base took some time, but reading the system schema helped organize relationships between classes.

Tools: Django, Python, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, Next.js

Course Notetaker ( [code](https://github.com/josueemartinezz/reportLogger) )
------
Purpose: A command-line tool that allows users to start note-taking for a subject, stop the note-taking application, view all entries, or view a report of the time elapsed and notes for each subject.

Challenges: Starting from the ground up with my code base was something uncomfortable, but worth every UML diagram.

Tools: Django, Python, PostgreSQL

File Compresssor and Decompressor ( [code](https://github.com/josueemartinezz/FileCompressor) )
------
Purpose: Using a huffman encoding, I learned how to read bytes from an input file and write to a output file in a smaller amount of bytes. Reducing compression size by 70%.  

Challenges: Knowing how integers can be represented in a more efficient way and stored in a smaller number of bytes. 

Tools: C++, Data Structures and Algorithms
