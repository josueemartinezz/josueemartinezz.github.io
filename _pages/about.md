<!-- SUMMARY -->
My name is Josue Martinez, I am studying Computer Science at the [University of California, San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu/) graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in June 2025. I'm a first-generation Latine who enjoys several applications of computing such software engineering, computing education, embedded systems, web development, machine learning, and cloud computing. 

<!-- CURRENTLY ON -->
## I'm currently...
1. Developing software at NSF funded DERConnect Research Lab. 
2. Wrapping up CSES's first iteration of the Alumni Mentorship Program.
3. Preparing the second iteration of the Alumni Mentorship Program and driving initiative for a web application to streamline manual work.
4. Developing learning initiative to embed Culturally Relevant Computing (CRC) principles into introductory programming courses at UCSD. 

<!-- EXPERIENCE -->
## Experience
- **Software Developer Research Assistant** (August 2024 - Present)
  - **UC San Diego Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department**
    - Developing software for DERConnect’s goal to help industry and academic researchers better understand how to integrate ever more distributed energy sources such as solar panels, wind turbines, smart buildings and electric vehicle batteries into the power grid.
- **Software Engineering Intern** (May 2024 - August 2024)
  - **Ectron Corporation**
    - Reduced business costs by 35% for B2B clients, as measured by a calculated increased saving for scalable resources per business, by designing a tiered Azure infrastructure with shared distributed resources from a single centralized virtual network.
    - Exceeded business requirements by designing machine learning workflows, resulting in efficient system monitoring for 30 small and medium-sized businesses, and established an efficient pipeline for data cleaning, model training, and model evaluations.
    - Advised 3 frontend associates on backend development, refactoring API structure, and routing practices.
- **Instructional Assistant** (February 2024 - Present)
  - **Computer Science and Engineering Department**
    - Led tutoring sessions at UC San Diego's upper-division course, Advanced Data Structures, with more than 400 enrolled students.
    - I received a 100% satisfaction rate from evaluations of over 30 students, demonstrating exceptional support and effectiveness.
    - Provided tailored lessons for students on material covering C++ and STL, high-performance data structures and supporting algorithms, and theoretical and practical performance analysis.
- **External Director** (September 2023 - Present)
  - **Computer Science and Engineering Society**
    - I spearheaded a first-of-its-kind, Alumni Mentorship Program, connecting undergraduate students with alumni in the technology industry for advice on academia, research, and industry experiences.
    - Leading a team of 4 officers to assist in program development, external outreach, and program execution.
- **Embedded Software Developer** (October 2023 - Present)
  - **UC San Diego Solar Car**
    - Established reliable telecommunication between sender and receiver RF modules, resulting in increased safety and energy efficiency, as measured by a 10% longer solar battery life and a quicker response time for anomaly detection.
    - Designed a multi-threaded solution for monitoring each electronic control unit located throughout the vehicle, providing concurrent reading and writing privileges to the MinIO server for telemetry logging.
    - Created real-time dashboard visualizations using Grafana to display power, speed, and energy data for the driver and response team.

## Undergraduate Research
<!-- **Culturally Relevant Computing** (May 2024 - Present)
  <img src="/images/research.jpeg" width="50%" text-align="center">

  **Objective**: Create a baseline environment that would evaluate fairness of college admission machine learning algorithms on the basis of income and test score. Thereby, promoting principles of equity and testing of deployed autonomous systems.

  **Significance**: This project was a fusion of all my passions including computer science and 
  philosophy; it involved purposeful computing that analyzes unfair disparities in college admissions.

<!-- PROJECTS -->
## Projects

### PantryPal ( [code](https://github.com/ucsd-cse110-fa23/cse-110-project-team-41) )
------
Purpose: Alleviating stress of college students who don't know what to cook with the ingredients they have.

Challenges: Testing frontend using JavaFx was a hassle, but I prioritized testing functionality on assumed events.

Tools: Java, MongoDB, JavaFX, Docker, UML, API’s (ChatGPT, Whisper, Dall-E), Mocking, Design Patterns

### Activist ( [code](https://github.com/josueemartinezz/activist) )
------
Purpose: Provide a platform that enables more people to safely engage in activism by making it easy to discover organizations and events as well as coordinate and collaborate on political action.

Challenges: Reading from a large code base took some time, but reading the system schema helped organize relationships between classes.

Tools: Django, Python, Redis, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, Next.js

### TrashPal ( [code](https://github.com/josueemartinezz/aisc) )
------
Purpose: Computer vision model to detect whether something should be composted, recycled, or thrown in the trash.

Challenges: Finding datasets to train the model, integrating it into an app to make it deployable.

Tools: Python, Yolo-v5, Computer Vision

### University Database ( [code](https://github.com/josueemartinezz/UniversityDatabase) )
------
Purpose: Master RDBMS by adding features that include schema design, custom indexing, materialized views, triggers, constraints, etc.

Challenges: Writing queries that required multi-layered joins across tables that I didn't expect to interact caused some complex queries.

Tools: PostgreSQL, Java, JSP, Tomcat Server

### Course Notetaker ( [code](https://github.com/josueemartinezz/reportLogger) )
------
Purpose: A command-line interface that allows users to start note-taking for a subject, stop the note-taking application, view all entries, or view a report of the time elapsed and notes for each subject.

Challenges: Starting from the ground up with my code base was something uncomfortable, but worth every UML diagram.

Tools: Django, Python, PostgreSQL

### File Compresssor and Decompressor ( [code](https://github.com/josueemartinezz/FileCompressor) )
------
Purpose: Using a huffman encoding, I learned how to read bytes from an input file and write to a output file in a smaller amount of bytes. Reducing compression size by 70%.  

Challenges: Knowing how integers can be represented in a more efficient way and stored in a smaller number of bytes. 

Tools: C++, GDB, Data Structures and Algorithms
