- Established reliable telecommunication between sender and receiver RF modules, resulting in increased safety and energy efficiency, as measured by a 10% longer solar battery life and a quicker response time for anomaly detection.
- Designed a multi-threaded solution for monitoring each electronic control unit located throughout the vehicle, providing concurrent reading and writing privileges to the MinIO server for telemetry logging.
- Created real-time dashboard visualizations using Grafana to display power, speed, and energy data for the driver and response team.
