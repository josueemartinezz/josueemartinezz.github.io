- Created computer vision model to detect whether something should be composted, recycled, or thrown in the trash.
- Using TensorFlow we trained the image classification model. Gathered a dataset of labeled images for compost, recycle, and trash items.
- Computed using Google Cloud AI Platform and then hosted cloud deployment using Google Cloud Functions.
