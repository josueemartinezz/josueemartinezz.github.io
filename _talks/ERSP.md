- Created simulation environments to test popular greedy ML algorithms, ensuring fairer decisions in college admissions and machine learning decision systems. 
- Defined the probabilistic transition states and reward functions that are defined for our Markov Decision Process on their policy values.  
- Engineered an optimized data structure using Python's Box subclass to design a standardized baseline environment to evaluate proximal policy greedy algorithms over long timesteps.
- Our research was accepted at the Early Research Scholars Program's National Conference.
